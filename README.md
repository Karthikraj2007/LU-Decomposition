# LU Decomposition 

## AIM:
To write a program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Import required libraries numpy and scipy.linalg.

2. Input the matrix/matrices using eval(input()).

3. Perform LU decomposition using lu() or solve equations using lu_factor() and lu_solve().

4. Print the results L and U matrices or solution X matrix

## Program:
(i) To find the L and U matrix
```
/*
Program to find the L and U matrix.

```
(ii) To find the LU Decomposition of a matrix
```
/*
Program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix.

```

## Output:
![lu decomposition]()


## Result:
Thus the program to find the LU Decomposition of a matrix is written and verified using python programming.
